# Udacity: Portfolio Website

Project 2 - Full Stack Web Developer

## Getting Started

The files within this repo will generate a webpage that displays projects I have completed or am currently working on. 
To get started, download the provided files within the repo.

### Creating the Webpage

* Download all files into a common directory.
* Open index.html in an internet browser address bar.
* Once webpage has loaded, click on featured works to be taken to the corresponding GitHub repo.

can be opened directly with a specified internet browser.
